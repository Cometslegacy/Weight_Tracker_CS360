    Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
      This project's goal was to create a basic android application that can help users track their weight and hit a target weight goal. We needed to be able to store currently entered weights into a database and allow users to have a basic login function, or continue as a guest. 
    What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
      Our first screen is the log-in screen. WHere the user can create a account locally and sign in, or continue as a guest. Then we needed the main screen, which allowed useres to see their target weight, current weight, and a list of previously entered weights to track their progress. We also included a very basic settings screen where users can enable SMS notifications for when their target weight is reached, and changing/updating their target weight
    How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
      I started by designing the UI on paper, then using androidstudio to replicate what I had drawn. I then started to code each function screen by screen. Trying to keep thing simple and easy to follow incase I had to come back later.
    How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
      I tested the code by running the app in an emulator and testing the functionallity of the things I created.
    Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
      WHen it came to the database to store information, initially we were prompted to use SQLite, but when reading the documentation I saw that it was not recommended to use that, and instead use "Rooms" which are built in to android and are an abstraction layer around SQLite. Since the documentation said to use rooms, I decided to give it a try.
    In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
      The creation of the database, I feel especially proud of that because I feel like it was a very elegant solution and does exactly what it needs to do, and has the ability to be expanded to include more things if desired.
